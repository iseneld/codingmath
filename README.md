# Coding Math
These are experiments that I made while following lectures by Keith Peters on trigonometry and mathematics relevant to programming animations. Incredibly fascinating stuff!

## How to use
To demo each experiment, (1) open the HTML-document, (2) change the connected .js file inside the Script tag's src attribute to any of the other files included in this repo.
